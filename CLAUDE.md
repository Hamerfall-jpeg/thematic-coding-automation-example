# Intro
Below you will find instructions on how to do thematic coding for qualitative analysis, which will be the main goal of the work in this repo.

# FYI: Language
Transcripts will be in Dutch. Coding system has English and Dutch components. Outputs should be in Dutch.

In the future, we might make an English coding system, or a system to consistently translate Dutch to English.

Coding Manual for Chronic Low Back Pain Self-Management Study

Based on Boeije's (2010) Three-Phase Coding Method

Qualitative Research on Patient Experiences

# Structure Overview

According to Boeije (2010), the coding manual should evolve through three phases:

## Phase 1: Open Coding

Identify and label concepts directly from the data

Stay close to participants' language

Create descriptive codes

## Phase 2: Axial Coding

Group related codes into categories

Identify relationships between codes

Connect to theoretical framework (biopsychosocial model)

## Phase 3: Selective Coding

Identify core themes

Refine and integrate categories

Ensure themes answer the research question


# Excel Implementation Structure

The coding manual should be implemented in Microsoft Excel with the following sheet structure:

## Sheet 1: Open Coding

Contains raw data from transcripts with applied codes.

| Participant | Quote | Line # | Code(s) Applied | Memo/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Example quote from transcript | 45 | BIO-03, SM-02 | Patient shows routine and skill |

## Sheet 2: Code Book

Contains all codes with definitions and examples (main coding manual).

## Sheet 3: Axial Coding

Groups related codes into broader categories.

## Sheet 4: Selective Coding / Themes

Identifies core themes from categories.


# Phase 1: Open Coding Manual
Note: there is also an exact copy of this in input/coding-system.md


The following codes are organized by the biopsychosocial model domains. Each code includes a unique identifier, name in Dutch and English, definition, and criteria for when to apply or not apply the code.

# Phase 2: Axial Coding - Category Development

After open coding, group related codes into broader categories. Categories represent higher-level concepts that emerge from patterns in the open codes.

## Suggested Categories

The following categories should be developed from your codes as patterns emerge:

| Category | Fysieke Dimensie van Zelfmanagement |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Physical dimension of self-management experiences |
| Related Codes | BIO-01, BIO-02, BIO-03, BIO-04 |
| Relationships | Connected to SM barriers/facilitators; influenced by PSY factors |

| Category | Psychologische Dimensie van Zelfmanagement |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Psychological dimension of self-management experiences |
| Related Codes | PSY-01, PSY-02, PSY-03, PSY-04, PSY-05 |
| Relationships | Influences BIO and SOC dimensions; shapes SM process |

| Category | Sociale Dimensie van Zelfmanagement |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Social dimension of self-management experiences |
| Related Codes | SOC-01, SOC-02, SOC-03, SOC-04 |
| Relationships | Provides context for SM barriers/facilitators; influences PSY factors |

| Category | Biopsychosociale Integratie |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Integration of biopsychosocial factors |
| Related Codes | BPS-01, BPS-02 |
| Relationships | Core concept linking all three domains; reflects understanding of holistic care |

| Category | Zelfmanagement Proces |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Self-management process and development |
| Related Codes | SM-01, SM-02, SM-03, SM-04 |
| Relationships | Central to research question; influenced by all three BPS domains |

# Phase 3: Selective Coding - Theme Development

After axial coding, identify core themes that answer the research question:

"How do patients with non-specific chronic low back pain experience self-management strategies within the framework of the biopsychosocial model?"

## Theme Development Criteria

Themes should:

Capture the essence of patient experiences

Answer the research question directly

Be supported by multiple categories

Be illustrated with participant quotes

| Theme # | Theme Name | Description | Supporting Categories | Key Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Theme 1 | To be developed from data | Core essence of patient experience | Which categories contribute | What makes this theme distinct |


# Coding Process Guidelines (Boeije, 2010)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. First Reading

Read transcript without coding to get overall sense of the content.

### 2. Open Coding

Read line-by-line

Apply codes from manual

Create new codes when existing ones don't fit

Update code book with new codes

### 3. Constant Comparison

Compare segments within same interview, then across interviews.

### 4. Memo Writing

Document thoughts, patterns, and relationships as they emerge.

### 5. Axial Coding

After 2-3 transcripts, begin grouping codes into categories.

### 6. Selective Coding

After all transcripts coded, identify core themes.

## Quality Checks

Each code should have clear boundaries (inclusion/exclusion)

Codes should be mutually exclusive when possible

Multiple codes can apply to same quote when appropriate

Stay close to participant language in open coding

Document all coding decisions in memos


# Research-Specific Tips

## Pay Attention To:

How patients describe the interaction between bio-psycho-social factors

Barriers and facilitators specific to each domain

How physiotherapists do or don't address multiple domains

Patient agency and autonomy in self-management

## Be Alert For:

Biomedical language vs. biopsychosocial language

Passive vs. active role descriptions

Integration vs. separation of domains

Understanding vs. confusion about biopsychosocial approach

## Starting With Your Initial Codes

Your three initial codes can expand into this manual:

"Lage rugpijn" splits into BIO-01 (experience) and BIO-02 (functional impact)

"Zelfmanagement" splits into SM-01 through SM-06 (knowledge, skills, confidence, autonomy, barriers, facilitators)

"Sociale context (+ effecten)" splits into SOC-01 through SOC-04 (social context, work impact, social support, social expectations)

## Important Reminders

This coding manual is a living document - update it as new codes emerge

Document all changes and decisions in your reflexive journal

Discuss emerging codes and categories with supervisors during peer debriefing

Stay flexible - allow the data to guide code development

Regularly review and refine code definitions to maintain consistency
