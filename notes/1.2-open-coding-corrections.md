# Open coding corrections
Recently you created CSVs following `1-open-coding.md`. We reviewed this, and found that some of your codings need 
correction. For each of the `TRANSCRIPT_NAME.csv` files in `output/`, read them and look for any rows where `wrong` is 
`TRUE`. You will also find a column called `wrong_reason`, with information about what to do instead. Please follow the 
instructions in that comment for each such row. Finally, create a new version of the CSV, `TRANSCRIPT_NAME-v2.csv`, with
the original correct rows, plus any newly updated, fixed rows. You can add a `last_updated` column and enter `v2` in it, 
indicating that a correction was made in version 2 of the file.
